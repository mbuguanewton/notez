While Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, offer promising solutions, they are often limited by their lack of domain-specific knowledge, leading to inaccurate or irrelevant responses. To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces an intelligent customer service system tailored for property management. The system integrates a customized LLM with the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, designed to provide accurate, context-aware, and personalized responses. By employing an intelligent agent to pull relevant data from a dedicated property management knowledge base, the system can engage tenants in real-time through an interactive interface, ensuring both efficiency and relevance in communication. Additionally, machine learning algorithms are employed to continuously improve the system‚Äôs performance.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<h3>üìù Selected Text (01/08/2025, 16:19:53)</h3>\n<blockquote>\"re often limited by their lack of domain-specific knowledge, leading to inaccurate or irrelevant responses.
